Experimental 2D game engine for Kha

Right now it is just less than an alpha version, simply named Frankenstein version. We are working on it and we hope to build a simple 2d framework upon the great Kha library. Basically we want to add a support for the TiledEditor and a simple collision system. Everything else is more than welcome...

Stay tuned!
